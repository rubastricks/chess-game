# Chess Game ♟️ 

Simple and fun chess game built in React.js and styled in Tailwind. On this game you can play against the computer and also with a friend in your local machine! The game knows all the Chess' rules and it blocks all the ilegal moves and pop-up a game over message when it gets checkmate. The game also has two buttons for reset and undo for the user preference while gaming.
